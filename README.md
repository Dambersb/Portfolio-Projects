## Introduction:

**A. Company:**

**B. Background information**  

Cyclistic offers an exclusive bike-share program that features over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. It is found that most of the users ride for liesure
 and about 30% use them to commute to work each day. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. Cycistics offers different pricing plans such as single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members
Of late, Cyclistics concluded that annual members are much more profitbale than casual riders and believe that maximizing the number of annual members will be a key to company's future growth.  
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will
be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a
very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic
program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
